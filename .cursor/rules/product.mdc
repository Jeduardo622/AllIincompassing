# Product Rules (Optional)

## Feature intent
- Always restate the user goal in product terms before editing.
- Preserve the smallest viable scope; avoid feature creep.
- Align changes to the ABA platform workflows and role-based access.

## UX constraints
- Prefer clarity over novelty; consistent copy and layout.
- Maintain accessibility: keyboard navigation, labels, and roles.
- Avoid regressions in critical paths (sign-in, onboarding, scheduling).

## Acceptance criteria conventions
- Use bullet-style ACs: `Given / When / Then` or `If / Then`.
- Each AC should be testable and map to a UI or API behavior.
- Include error states and empty states where applicable.
