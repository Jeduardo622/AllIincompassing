[Supabase](https://supabase.io) is an open source Firebase alternative. We're building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade open source tools.

This repository contains all the functionality for Supabase CLI.

- [x] Running Supabase locally
- [x] Managing database migrations
- [x] Creating and deploying Supabase Functions
- [x] Generating types directly from your database schema
- [x] Making authenticated HTTP requests to [Management API](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/introduction)

## Session scheduling idempotency

The scheduling workflow for session holds now enforces idempotency across the `sessions-hold`, `sessions-confirm`, and `sessions-cancel` Edge Functions. Clients can supply an `Idempotency-Key` header with each POST request to ensure retries never create duplicate reservations or confirmations.

- When an `Idempotency-Key` is provided, the function stores a SHA-256 hash of the JSON response alongside the original payload metadata. Subsequent requests using the same key return the stored response immediately and include an `Idempotent-Replay: true` header without re-running business logic.
- Responses generated on initial execution are stored with their HTTP status codes, so repeated keys receive the exact same status/body combination.
- The new `sessions-cancel` endpoint releases held slots and also participates in the idempotency flow, allowing client-side retries when releasing a hold.

### CPT-compliant duration rounding

- `confirm_session_hold` now rounds session durations to the nearest 15-minute increment (minimum one unit) before persisting and returning the session payload. This keeps billing calculations aligned with CPT reporting rules.
- The `sessions-confirm` Edge Function surfaces the rounded value via both `data.session.duration_minutes` and `data.roundedDurationMinutes`, ensuring front-end scheduling flows and downstream billing logic consume the compliant duration without re-implementing rounding rules.
- If you change the CPT increment in the future, update the constant inside the PL/pgSQL function and adjust any client expectations that rely on the `roundedDurationMinutes` helper field.

Example request using `fetch`:

```ts
await fetch(`${SUPABASE_EDGE_URL}/sessions-hold`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    "Idempotency-Key": crypto.randomUUID(),
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    therapist_id: "...",
    client_id: "...",
    start_time: "2025-01-01T10:00:00Z",
    end_time: "2025-01-01T11:00:00Z",
  }),
});
```

Clients should persist and reuse the same key for retries to guarantee safe replays.

## Getting started

### Install the CLI

Available via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) as dev dependency. To install:

```bash
npm i supabase --save-dev
```

To install the beta release channel:

```bash
npm i supabase@beta --save-dev
```

When installing with yarn 4, you need to disable experimental fetch with the following nodejs config.

```
NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-fetch yarn add supabase
```

> **Note**
For Bun versions below v1.0.17, you must add `supabase` as a [trusted dependency](https://bun.sh/guides/install/trusted) before running `bun add -D supabase`.

### Run the CLI

```bash

```

Or using npx:

```bash
npx supabase bootstrap
```

The bootstrap command will guide you through the process of setting up a Supabase project using one of the [starter](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-samples/blob/main/samples.json) templates.

## Docs

Command & config reference can be found [here](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/about).

## Breaking changes

We follow semantic versioning for changes that directly impact CLI commands, flags, and configurations.

However, due to dependencies on other service images, we cannot guarantee that schema migrations, seed.sql, and generated types will always work for the same CLI major version. If you need such guarantees, we encourage you to pin a specific version of CLI in package.json.

## Developing

To run from source:

```sh
# Go >= 1.22
go run . help
```

# Database-First CI/CD Pipeline

A streamlined CI/CD pipeline for Supabase projects following database-first development practices.

## 🚀 Features

- **Simple & Practical**: Based on real-world Supabase deployment patterns
- **Database-First**: Migrations drive deployments, not the other way around
- **Branch-Based Deployments**: `develop` → staging, `main` → production
- **Type Safety**: Automatic TypeScript type generation and validation
- **Automated Backups**: Production backups before deployments
- **Clean & Minimal**: No unnecessary complexity or bloat

## 📋 Requirements

### GitHub Secrets

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### Repository Structure

```
.
├── .github/workflows/
│   └── database-first-ci.yml
├── supabase/
│   ├── migrations/
│   └── config.toml
├── scripts/
│   └── cleanup-supabase-branch.js
└── types.gen.ts
```

## 🎯 How It Works

This workflow uses a **single Supabase project** with branch-based deployments:

### On Pull Requests
1. **Test & Validate**: Run tests and validate type generation
2. **Migration Check**: Detect new migrations for review

### On Push to `develop`
1. **Deploy to Supabase**: Apply migrations and update types
2. **Create Deployment Comment**: Summary of changes

### On Push to `main`
1. **Create Backup**: Backup production database
2. **Deploy to Production**: Apply migrations and update types  
3. **Create Deployment Comment**: Summary with dashboard link

### Weekly Cleanup
- Remove old backup files
- Clean up old workflow runs

> **Note**: This workflow uses a single Supabase project with branch-based deployments. For true staging/production separation, you'd need separate Supabase projects and different `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` values.

## 🛠 Usage

### 1. Create a Migration
```bash
supabase migration new add_users_table
```

### 2. Test Locally
```bash
supabase db start
supabase db reset
npm test
```

### 3. Deploy via Git
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add users table migration"
git push origin develop  # Deploy to staging
```

### 4. Production Deployment
```bash
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main     # Deploy to production
```

## 📁 Scripts

### `scripts/cleanup-supabase-branch.js`
- Clean up old Supabase branches
- Pattern-based cleanup (e.g., PR branches)
- Age-based cleanup (branches older than X days)
- Dry-run mode for safety

### Usage
```bash
# Clean up branches older than 7 days
node scripts/cleanup-supabase-branch.js --max-age 7

# Clean up PR branches matching pattern
node scripts/cleanup-supabase-branch.js --pattern "^pr-"

# Dry run (preview changes)
node scripts/cleanup-supabase-branch.js --dry-run --max-age 7
```

### `scripts/admin-password-reset.js`
- Reset a user's password or create the account if it does not exist
- Requires Supabase service role credentials loaded from your environment; the script throws if `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is missing or blank

#### Usage
```bash
# Supply the service role key through the environment (e.g. shell export or .env file)
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="<your-service-role-key>"

# Optional: override the Supabase project URL if you are using a non-default project
export SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"

# Execute the script with the target account details
node scripts/admin-password-reset.js user@example.com NewPass123 true
```

> ℹ️  The script reads configuration via `dotenv`, so storing the key in a local `.env` file is supported. Keep the key out of version control and CI logs. The script does not include any fallback key and will exit early if the environment variable is omitted.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Optional: Customize behavior
SUPABASE_CLI_VERSION=latest
NODE_VERSION=18
```

### Supabase Configuration
Ensure your `supabase/config.toml` is properly configured:

```toml
[api]
enabled = true
port = 54321

[db]
port = 54322

[studio]
enabled = true
port = 54323
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Migration Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Reset local database and reapply migrations
   supabase db reset
   ```

2. **Type Generation Issues**
   ```bash
   # Manually regenerate types
   supabase gen types typescript --local > types.gen.ts
   ```

3. **Permission Errors**
   ```bash
   # Check Supabase access token permissions
   supabase projects list
   ```

## 📝 Best Practices

1. **Always test locally first** with `supabase db start`
2. **Use staging environment** for final validation
3. **Keep migrations small** and focused
4. **Test type generation** after schema changes
5. **Review deployment comments** for confirmation
