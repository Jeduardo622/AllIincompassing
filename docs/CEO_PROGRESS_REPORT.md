# ABA Platform Progress Report

*A. Executive Summary*

The AI-first ABA platform is converging on a production-ready baseline: Supabase preview environments now isolate data per pull request, billing logic is codified with CPT/modifier handling, and the Netlify deployment path is stable again after resolving the React #130 regression. These wins, combined with active diagnostics across all user domains and the launch of Lighthouse/PWA readiness work, signal strong momentum toward a compliant, clinician-friendly release despite remaining gaps around environment parity, automation depth, and AI safety guardrails.

*B. Highlights / Achievements*

- **Automated database previews**: Supabase GitHub integration now provisions branch-specific databases, reducing drift and giving reviewers realistic data sandboxes.
- **Billing engine maturity**: CPT + modifier rules are implemented with supporting RPC migrations, enabling accurate claims preparation and future payer validation.
- **Deployment reliability restored**: Resolved the Netlify React #130 error, unlocking consistent preview/site builds tied to main.
- **Domain diagnostics**: Completed full QA sweeps for Clients, Therapists, Admins, and Super Admin flows, producing actionable issue logs.
- **Performance groundwork**: Initiated Lighthouse audits and PWA scaffolding for offline-capable session workflows.

*C. Challenges / Risks*

- **Environment parity**: Preview databases require ongoing seed automation and secrets governance to stay aligned with staging/production.
- **Billing validation**: Need payer-specific test cases and clearinghouse integration to fully certify CPT/modifier outputs.
- **AI prompt safety** *(assumption)*: Guardrails for agentic assistants (scheduling, billing, documentation, recording) are still draft-only; requires red-team testing.
- **Operational load**: Diagnostics surfaced cross-team fixes; prioritization and ownership assignments still in flight.

*D. Upcoming Work / Requests*

- **Production readiness checklist**: Finalize performance, accessibility, HIPAA compliance, and agent safety gates; target completion within the next sprint.
- **Billing test cycle**: Schedule end-to-end claims dry run with finance stakeholders and confirm clearinghouse connectivity.
- **Preview automation**: Add seeded fixtures and obfuscated PHI datasets to Supabase preview creation pipeline.
- **Executive requests**:
  1. Approve Supabase paid tier + billing subscription to sustain preview environments.
  2. Greenlight QA budget for external accessibility and security testing.
  3. Confirm timeline for clinician advisory board review of AI assistant flows.

*E. Strategic Alignment*

- **Faster therapy delivery**: Reliable deployments, agentic scheduling, and offline/PWA work shorten intake-to-session timelines.
- **Compliance readiness**: Database isolation, HIPAA-focused diagnostics, and upcoming security audits keep us on track for regulatory requirements.
- **Clinician & family experience**: Billing accuracy and domain-specific QA drive trust, while performance audits ensure responsive, modern UX.

*Status at a Glance*

| Domain      | Status |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Clients     | âœ… Stable diagnostics; minor UX cleanup pending |
| Therapists  | âœ… Core workflows verified; awaiting AI assistant guardrails |
| Admins      | ðŸŸ§ Needs environment parity + billing validation |
| Super Admin | ðŸŸ§ Monitoring preview automation + governance |

*Timeline Snapshot*

- **Week of Oct 7**: Production readiness checklist & billing test cycle.
- **Week of Oct 14** *(assumption)*: AI safety validation and PWA offline drills.
- **Week of Oct 21** *(assumption)*: Go/No-Go review for limited release.
