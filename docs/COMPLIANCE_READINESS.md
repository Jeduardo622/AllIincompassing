# Compliance Readiness

## Current posture
This document tracks compliance artifacts and gaps for external readiness (e.g., HIPAA, SOC2).

## Existing artifacts
- Security checklist: `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`
- Audit summary: `AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- Security runbooks: `docs/security/`
- Observability baseline: `docs/OBSERVABILITY_RUNBOOK.md`

## Gaps to close
- Formal compliance certification evidence (HIPAA, SOC2, etc.).
- Documented control mappings (policy → procedure → evidence).
- Evidence retention plan for audit logs and admin actions.

## Next steps
1. Define target certification(s) and scope.
2. Map controls to existing procedures and identify missing evidence.
3. Establish evidence collection cadence (quarterly review).
