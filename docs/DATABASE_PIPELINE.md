## 🎯 Overview

The database-first CI/CD pipeline solves critical problems:

- **Database Migration Conflicts**: Each PR gets its own isolated database branch
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Automated security scanning with RLS checks
- **Performance Regressions**: Performance monitoring and slow query detection
- **Integration Issues**: Comprehensive testing with real database environments
- **Deployment Safety**: Production health checks and rollback capabilities

### Key Benefits

- ✅ **Zero Migration Conflicts**: Isolated database per PR
- ✅ **Automated Security**: RLS policies, exposed functions, security advisors
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Slow query detection, index optimization
- ✅ **Preview Deployments**: Full-stack previews with isolated databases
- ✅ **Health Reporting**: Comprehensive reports in PR comments
- ✅ **Production Safety**: Post-deployment health checks

```

## ⚙️ Setup Requirements

### GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_supabase_access_token
SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=wnnjeqheqxxyrgsjmygy
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# OpenAI for AI features
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Netlify for deployments
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_netlify_auth_token
NETLIFY_SITE_ID=your_netlify_site_id
```

> 🔒 Provide these values via your CI/CD secret store. Scripts that require elevated access, including `scripts/admin-password-reset.js`, will abort if `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is missing or blank; no fallback credentials are embedded.

### Local Development Setup

1. **Install Supabase CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g supabase
   ```

2. **Login to Supabase**:
   ```bash
   supabase login
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 🤖 GitHub Actions Workflows

### Main Workflow: `database-first-ci.yml`

**Triggers**: PR events (opened, synchronize, reopened, closed) and pushes to main

**Jobs**:

1. **setup-pr-environment**
   - Creates Supabase development branch
   - Applies migrations to branch database
   - Generates TypeScript types
   - Commits updated types back to PR

2. **test-and-validate** (Matrix Strategy)
   - Unit tests with branch database
   - Integration tests with real data
   - E2E tests with Cypress

3. **database-health-check**
   - Security analysis with Supabase advisors
   - RLS policy verification
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Comments health report on PR

4. **deploy-preview**
   - Builds application with branch database
   - Deploys to Netlify preview URL
   - Comments deployment URL on PR

5. **cleanup-pr-environment** (On PR close)
   - Deletes Supabase development branch
   - Removes Netlify preview deployment
   - Cleans up cache files

6. **production-deploy** (On main push)
   - Applies migrations to production
   - Deploys to production Netlify
   - Runs production health checks

## 🏥 Database Health Monitoring

### Security Checks

The pipeline automatically checks for:

- **RLS Policies**: Ensures all tables have Row Level Security enabled
- **Exposed Functions**: Verifies functions use SECURITY DEFINER
- **Security Advisors**: Runs Supabase security recommendations
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Fails CI on critical security issues

### Performance Analysis

Performance monitoring includes:

- **Slow Queries**: Identifies queries > 1000ms total time
- **Missing Indexes**: Finds tables with high sequential scans
- **Table Bloat**: Detects tables with high dead tuple ratios
- **Connection Stats**: Monitors active database connections

### Health Report Format

Each PR gets a comprehensive health report:

```markdown
# 🏥 Database Health Report

## 📊 Overall Health: 🟢 EXCELLENT

| Metric | Score | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| 🔒 Security | 95/100 | 🟢 Excellent |
| ⚡ Performance | 88/100 | 🟡 Good |
| 📋 Total Issues | 2 | ⚠️ Found |
| 🚨 Critical Issues | 0 | ✅ None |

## 💡 Recommendations
- ⚠️ **PERFORMANCE**: Add indexes to 2 tables
- 💡 _Action: CREATE INDEX ON table_name (column_name);_
```

## 🛠️ Manual Commands

### Database Branch Management

```bash
# Create a new database branch
npm run db:branch:create branch-name

# Cleanup a database branch
npm run db:branch:cleanup branch-name

# Cleanup multiple branches by pattern
node scripts/cleanup-supabase-branch.js --pattern "pr-.*"
```

### Health Checks

```bash
# Run security analysis
npm run db:check:security branch-id

# Run performance analysis
npm run db:check:performance branch-id

# Generate combined health report
npm run db:health:report branch-id

# Check production health
npm run db:health:production

# Run all health checks
npm run pipeline:health branch-id
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# 2. Make database changes
# Add migration files to supabase/migrations/

# 3. Test locally with branch database
supabase db push --project-ref your-branch-id

# 4. Run health checks locally
npm run pipeline:health your-branch-id

# 5. Create PR - pipeline runs automatically
gh pr create
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Branch Creation Fails
```bash
Error: Cost confirmation required
```
**Solution**: The script handles cost confirmation automatically. If it fails, check Supabase billing settings.

#### 2. Migration Conflicts
```bash
Error: Migration conflict detected
```
**Solution**: Resolve conflicts in migration files and push again. The isolated branch prevents conflicts with main.

#### 3. Type Generation Fails
```bash
Error: Failed to generate types
```
**Solution**: Check database connection and ensure migrations applied successfully.

#### 4. Security Check Failures
```bash
Error: Critical security issues found
```
**Solution**: Review the health report and address RLS policies or security advisors.

#### 5. Performance Warnings
```bash
Warning: Slow queries detected
```
**Solution**: Optimize queries and add indexes as recommended in the health report.

### Debug Commands

```bash
# List all branches
supabase branches list

# Check branch status
supabase branches get branch-id

# View migration status
supabase db diff --schema public

# Test database connection
supabase db query 'SELECT NOW();' --project-ref branch-id
```

### Log Locations

- **GitHub Actions**: Check the Actions tab in your repository
- **Local Reports**: `.reports/` directory
- **Branch Cache**: `.cache/supabase-branches/`
- **Supabase Logs**: Use `supabase logs` command

## 📈 Monitoring & Metrics

### Pipeline Metrics

- **PR Processing Time**: Time from PR creation to deployment
- **Migration Success Rate**: Percentage of successful migrations
- **Security Issue Detection**: Number of issues caught pre-production
- **Performance Regression Detection**: Queries optimized per month

### Health Score Calculation

**Security Score (0-100)**:

- High severity issues: -20 points each
- Medium severity issues: -10 points each
- Low severity warnings: -5 points each

**Performance Score (0-100)**:
- Critical slow queries (>5s): -25 points each
- Slow queries: -10 points each
- Missing indexes: -5 points each

**Overall Health**:
- 85-100: Excellent 🟢

- 50-69: Fair 🟠
- 0-49: Poor 🔴

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:

- **Performance Baselines**: Compare performance against main branch
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime production deployments
- **Rollback Automation**: Automatic rollback on health check failures
