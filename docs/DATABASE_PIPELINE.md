## 🎯 Overview

The “database-first” workflow combines a focused GitHub Action (`supabase-validate.yml`), the general CI pipeline, and a set of Supabase CLI scripts. Together they lint migrations, run integration tests against the hosted project (`wnnjeqheqxxyrgsjmygy`), and give contributors tools to spin up Supabase branches when they need isolated data.

The current implementation does **not** create per-PR Supabase branches automatically. Instead, engineers run the supplied scripts (see [Manual Commands](#-manual-commands)) whenever a feature actually requires a dedicated database copy. CI reuses the shared project and enforces safety via linting and tests.

### Key Components & Benefits

- ✅ **Migration linting on PRs** – `supabase-validate.yml` runs `supabase db lint` whenever a PR touches `supabase/migrations/**`.【.github/workflows/supabase-validate.yml†L4-L26】
- ✅ **Hosted-integration tests on push** – the same workflow runs `npm test` with `RUN_DB_IT=1` for pushes to `main`, guaranteeing RLS-aware suites execute against real Supabase credentials.【.github/workflows/supabase-validate.yml†L27-L46】
- ✅ **Full project CI** – `.github/workflows/ci.yml` adds linting, coverage, Netlify deploys, and smoke tests so schema changes are exercised together with the app code.【.github/workflows/ci.yml†1-L215】
- ✅ **On-demand previews** – `supabase-preview.yml` provides a manual workflow for rapidly bringing up an ephemeral Supabase stack when deeper QA is needed.【.github/workflows/supabase-preview.yml†1-L37】
- ✅ **Branch utilities** – `npm run db:branch:create|cleanup` wrap the Supabase CLI so engineers can create, reuse, and destroy database branches without crafting CLI commands by hand.

## 🔄 Pipeline Flow

1. **Pull request touches migrations**
   - `supabase-validate.yml` triggers `lint-migrations`, which checks out the PR, installs the Supabase CLI, and runs `supabase db lint --linked`. Failures block the PR until policies, functions, and grants pass lint.
2. **Push to `main`**
   - `supabase-validate.yml` runs the `test-main` job. It installs dependencies, sets `RUN_DB_IT=1`, injects hosted Supabase credentials, and executes `npm test` so database-backed Vitest suites run with live data.
3. **Repo-wide CI (`ci.yml`)**
   - For every PR/push, the standard CI pipeline validates secrets, runs ESLint/TypeScript, executes Vitest with Supabase credentials, enforces coverage, builds canary bundles, and (on `develop`) deploys to Netlify staging before running smoke tests.
4. **Optional Supabase preview**
   - When needed, maintainers run `Supabase Preview` via the **Actions** tab to start a local Supabase stack (`supabase start`, `supabase db reset`) for exploratory testing.
5. **Manual Supabase branch workflow**
   - If a change needs an isolated database, run `npm run db:branch:create pr-123` locally, apply migrations, and work against that branch. Cleanup via `npm run db:branch:cleanup pr-123` when done. These scripts are not wired into Actions yet, keeping branch creation intentional rather than automatic.

## ⚙️ Setup Requirements

### GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_supabase_access_token
SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=wnnjeqheqxxyrgsjmygy
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# OpenAI for AI features
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Netlify for deployments
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_netlify_auth_token
NETLIFY_SITE_ID=your_netlify_site_id
```

> 🔒 Provide these values via your CI/CD secret store. Scripts that require elevated access, including `scripts/admin-password-reset.js`, will abort if `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is missing or blank; no fallback credentials are embedded.

Expose the read-only Supabase credentials to CI jobs so the RLS security tests can authenticate:

```yaml
env:
  SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_URL }}
  SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY }}
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY }}
```

For local runs, export the same variables and set `RUN_DB_IT=1` before invoking `npm test` to opt into the database-backed suites.

### Local Development Setup

1. **Install Supabase CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g supabase
   ```

2. **Login to Supabase**:
   ```bash
   supabase login
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 🤖 GitHub Actions Workflows

### `supabase-validate.yml`
- **Triggers**: Pull requests that modify `supabase/migrations/**` and pushes to `main` touching those paths.【.github/workflows/supabase-validate.yml†4-L13】
- **PR behavior**: Runs `supabase db lint --linked` to ensure policies, grants, and SQL syntax conform before review.【.github/workflows/supabase-validate.yml†15-L26】
- **Push behavior**: Installs dependencies and executes `npm test` with `RUN_DB_IT=1`, pointing to the hosted Supabase environment so RLS and RPC tests run against real data.【.github/workflows/supabase-validate.yml†27-L46】

### `ci.yml`
- **Triggers**: All PRs and pushes.
- **Focus**: Validates secrets, runs ESLint/TypeScript, executes Vitest with Supabase credentials, enforces coverage, builds canary bundles, deploys to Netlify staging on `develop`, and runs smoke tests plus route audits.【.github/workflows/ci.yml†1-L248】
- **Why it matters for the database**: Because `RUN_DB_IT` is set for Vitest, schema and RLS regressions surface during the general CI build even when migrations are untouched.

### `database-first-ci.yml`
- **Triggers**: Pushes to `main` and `develop`. (It intentionally omits PR events for now.)【.github/workflows/database-first-ci.yml†1-L12】
- **Scope**: Currently a thin placeholder that checks out the repository and is ready for future branch automation. We keep it documented so future automation work has a home and we remember it runs on every protected branch push.

### `supabase-preview.yml`
- **Triggers**: Manual `workflow_dispatch`.
- **Focus**: Starts a local Supabase stack via `supabase start`, resets the database, optionally runs type generation, and surfaces connection info so developers can point their local app at the ephemeral environment.【.github/workflows/supabase-preview.yml†1-L37】
- **Use case**: Great for QA/debug sessions when you need a clean Supabase instance but don’t want to create a managed branch.

## 🏥 Database Health Monitoring

CI currently surfaces schema issues through tests and linting; deeper health checks remain opt-in via the supplied scripts. Run them locally, in a Codespace, or from a scheduled job when needed:

- `npm run db:check:security <branch-id>` – wraps Supabase advisors and our RLS/policy checks.
- `npm run db:check:performance <branch-id>` – scrapes pg_stat views for slow queries, missing indexes, and bloat.
- `npm run db:health:report <branch-id>` – produces a consolidated Markdown report using the outputs above.
- `npm run db:health:production` – shortcuts to the production reference (`wnnjeqheqxxyrgsjmygy`) for release audits.
- `npm run pipeline:health <branch-id>` – convenience script that runs security + performance + report in one go.

### Security Checks

The security script focuses on:

- **RLS coverage** – fails if tables under `public` miss RLS or if policies conflict with helper functions.
- **Function hardening** – verifies `SECURITY DEFINER` and locked-down `search_path` on helper functions.
- **Supabase advisors** – relays any high/critical recommendations Supabase emits for the project.

### Performance Analysis

The performance script highlights:

- **Slow queries** – anything over ~1000 ms cumulative time.
- **Missing/unused indexes** – looks for high seq scans vs. tuples returned.
- **Table bloat** – flags tables with large dead tuple ratios.
- **Connection stats** – simple `pg_stat_activity` snapshot for runaway clients.

### Health Report Format

Running `npm run db:health:report branch-id` emits Markdown similar to the following, which you can paste into a PR comment or attach to release notes:

```markdown

```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Branch Creation Fails
```bash
Error: Cost confirmation required
```
**Solution**: The script handles cost confirmation automatically. If it fails, check Supabase billing settings.

#### 2. Migration Conflicts
```bash
Error: Migration conflict detected
```
**Solution**: Resolve conflicts in migration files and push again. The isolated branch prevents conflicts with main.

#### 3. Type Generation Fails
```bash
Error: Failed to generate types
```
**Solution**: Check database connection and ensure migrations applied successfully.

#### 4. Security Check Failures
```bash
Error: Critical security issues found
```
**Solution**: Review the health report and address RLS policies or security advisors.

#### 5. Performance Warnings
```bash
Warning: Slow queries detected
```
**Solution**: Optimize queries and add indexes as recommended in the health report.

### Debug Commands

```bash
# List all branches
supabase branches list

# Check branch status
supabase branches get branch-id

# View migration status
supabase db diff --schema public

# Test database connection
psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -c "SELECT NOW();"
```
