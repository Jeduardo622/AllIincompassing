## Supabase Advisors Summary (2025-10-28)

Target project: `wnnjeqheqxxyrgsjmygy`

Summary:
- Security: No actionable findings returned in this run.
- Performance: Advisors reported common efficiency issues. Prioritize the following categories:
  - Unindexed foreign keys
  - RLS policies repeatedly evaluating `current_setting()`/`auth.*` (initplan)
  - Unused indexes
  - Multiple permissive policies per table/action

Representative affected areas (not exhaustive):
- `public.feature_flag_audit_logs`, `public.feature_flags`, `public.impersonation_audit`, `public.organization_plans`
- Many tables with permissive RLS layers and computed checks

Remediation references:
- Unindexed foreign keys: `https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/advisors/unindexed_foreign_keys`
- RLS initplan: `https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/advisors/auth_rls_initplan`
- Unused index: `https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/advisors/unused_index`
- Multiple permissive policies: `https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/advisors/multiple_permissive_policies`

Recommended next steps:
- Add covering indexes for frequently joined FKs (prioritize high‑traffic joins).
- Refactor RLS policies to avoid per‑row evaluation of `current_setting()`/`auth.*`.
- Drop unused indexes after validating in staging over a full traffic window.
- Consolidate permissive policies where possible to reduce evaluation overhead.

Note: Full raw advisor outputs are large; this summary captures categories and remediation links for tracking.
