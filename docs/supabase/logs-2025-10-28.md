## Supabase Logs Snapshot (last 24h)

Project: `wnnjeqheqxxyrgsjmygy`  
Captured: 2025-10-28

API service highlights:
- 0 observed 4xx (API), 0 observed 5xx in sampled entries
- Multiple `101` WebSocket upgrades (`/realtime/v1/websocket`) – expected
- Repeated `200` reads on `/rest/v1/profiles`, `/rest/v1/therapists`, `/rest/v1/clients`
- RPC `get_session_metrics` returned `300` in a few calls – review RPC handler/inputs

Auth service highlights:
- Cluster of invalid credential attempts with `400` at ~17:26–17:27Z, followed by successful logins (password then token refresh)
- GoTrue deprecation notices: `GOTRUE_JWT_DEFAULT_GROUP_NAME` and `GOTRUE_JWT_ADMIN_GROUP_NAME`
- No 5xx observed

Follow-ups:
- Verify why `get_session_metrics` intermittently returns `300`; standardize response
- Remove deprecated GoTrue group name envs if present in runtime config
- Keep monitoring for repeated invalid credential bursts (potential user error vs brute force)
