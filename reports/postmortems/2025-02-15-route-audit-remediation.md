# Route Audit Remediation Postmortem – 2025-02-15

## Executive Summary
All remediation milestones (Day-0 through Week-2) completed successfully following the hardened preview pipeline and Supabase-integrated CI gates. The cross-team collaboration eliminated the route-auth regressions surfaced in the original audit and delivered automated evidence capture for ongoing compliance reviews.

## Milestone Outcomes
- **Day-0 (D0-1, D0-2):** Preview smoke build stabilized and route guard audit validated Supabase RBAC enforcement across guarded routes.
- **Week-1 (W1-1, W1-2):** CI workflow now enforces coverage baselines, retains smoke artifacts, and production RPC helpers replace stub implementations with ≥90% test coverage.
- **Week-2 (W2-1, W2-2):** Compliance dashboard automation emits weekly artifacts consumed by documentation updates that institutionalize the audit cadence.

- Compliance dashboard snapshots: [`reports/dashboard-backups/`](../dashboard-backups/) (latest run ID `local-20251010-metrics-generate`)

## Lessons Learned
1. **Preview determinism is essential.** Automating environment bootstrap (`npm run preview:build` / `preview:smoke`) prevents downstream audits from blocking on missing URLs or scripts.
2. **Coverage enforcement must normalize paths.** The updated verification script ensures consistent comparisons across local and CI environments, avoiding false negatives from absolute paths.
3. **Supabase credential hydration requires guardrails.** The resolver centralizes service-role usage with explicit messaging, keeping security suites reliable without leaking secrets.
4. **Route audit tooling benefits from shared helpers.** Reusing preview runtime utilities between smoke, Cypress, and audit runners reduced drift and simplified evidence capture.

## Follow-up Actions
- Monitor upcoming CI runs to confirm Supabase credential hydration succeeds in hosted pipelines.
- Schedule quarterly reviews of `reports/coverage-baseline.json` to keep thresholds aligned with evolving code paths.
- Evaluate opportunities to integrate compliance dashboard exports into stakeholder Slack channels for real-time visibility.
