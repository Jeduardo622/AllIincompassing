# Route Guard Verification â€“ 2025-02-21

## Preview smoke availability
- `CI=1 npm run preview:build` succeeded, producing static preview assets and baseline URL output. [Log chunk `04a215`]
- `CI=1 npm run preview:smoke` passed against the local preview server with Supabase stubs. [Log chunk `5a4481`]
- `CI=1 npm run preview:smoke -- --reporter=junit` re-ran the suite for artifact generation; all checks remained green. [Log chunk `eab9d8`]

## Route guard enforcement tests
- `npm run test -- --runInBand --grep "route guard"` now executes only the guard-related suites and passes. [Log chunk `a73221`]
- New unit coverage: `src/server/routes/__tests__/guards.test.ts` validates guard matrices, role hierarchy, and Supabase policy alignment; `src/components/__tests__/RoleGuard.test.tsx` confirms UI redirection semantics.

## Blocked verification commands
- `npm run audit:routes` remains blocked because Playwright cannot launch Chromium in the container; missing system libraries prevent execution. [Log chunk `933d1b`]
- `npm run test:routes` fails due to the absence of the Xvfb display server required by Cypress. [Log chunk `e53fab`]

## Follow-up actions
- Provision a container image (or CI job) with Playwright system dependencies and Xvfb to clear the remaining Day-0 verification gates.
- Once the environment supports browser automation, re-run `npm run audit:routes` and `npm run test:routes`, capturing artifacts for the execution spec.
