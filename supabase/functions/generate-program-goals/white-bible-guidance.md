White Bible ABA guidance (repo source)

- Keep goals socially significant and directly tied to prioritized client outcomes.
- Write goals as observable behavior change targets, not personality traits or vague skills.
- Use operational definitions so two clinicians can score behavior consistently.
- Tie interventions and goals to function-based understanding from the FBA context.
- Include baseline context when available and avoid overstating certainty when data is missing.
- Prefer explicit measurement methods (frequency, duration, latency, percentage, or interval recording).
- Include clear mastery criteria (criterion level + context + consistency requirement).
- Keep wording implementation-ready for therapists and caregivers in routine settings.
- Avoid duplicative goals by ensuring each goal targets a distinct behavior or condition.
- Favor conservative, realistic targets that can be progressed across sessions.
